The model and controller were chopped out. We can chat about the code in lab.

The current MainActivity class does not adhere to the DRY (Don't repeat yourself) principle.
Note, the true_button and false_button are fairly close in functionality. The next_button some somewhat close to the true_button and false_button.
Some refactoring is in order.
